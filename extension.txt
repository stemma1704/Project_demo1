Dear DBS Admissions Office,

I hope this mail finds you well. My name is Stemy Tomy, and I am a prospective student for the Data Analytics program at Dublin Business School, with a student ID of 20024373.

I am writing to request a 2-week extension for the commencement date of my Data Analytics program, currently scheduled to start on January 22, 2024. While I fully understand the significance of adhering to the academic calendar, unforeseen circumstances have arisen that necessitate my presence in India to take essential exams that coincide with the program's original commencement date.

I am presently pursuing a diploma in Big Data from India's prestigious government institution, the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC). These exams are a crucial component of my academic commitments, and I have diligently endeavored to align my schedule to avoid conflicts. Regrettably, due to the nature of these examinations, it is impossible for me to be in two places at once.



I am deeply committed to my education at DBS, and I want to assure you that I will make every effort to catch up on any missed material during the two-week extension. I am eager to commence my studies at your esteemed institution and to actively contribute to the academic community.



Furthermore, I would like to mention how this course aligns with my aspirations for future academic pursuits. The Data Analytics program at DBS will equip me with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the field of data analysis. This foundation is pivotal for my future goals, which include pursuing a Master's degree in a related field. I believe that the knowledge and expertise gained during this program will provide a solid foundation for my Master's studies and enhance my career prospects.



I sincerely thank you for your understanding and consideration of this request. I eagerly await your response and am hopeful for a positive outcome.
